# MiniProject
Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

The objective of this project is to automate the detection of pneumonia using chest X-rays by comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Both the models were implemented on a Kaggle chest X-ray dataset. A GUI has been designed that accepts X-ray images, predicts pneumonia, and computes and displays the congestion percentage. The CNN obtained an accuracy of 92.63% and outperforms the MLP. For this purpose, the custom CNN model was used within the GUI, and it performed positively to results in terms of detecting pneumonia.
