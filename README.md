# MiniProject
This project automates pneumonia detection using chest X-rays by comparing a custom CNN and MLP on a Kaggle dataset. A GUI predicts pneumonia and shows congestion percentage. The CNN achieved 92.63% accuracy, outperforming MLP, and is used in the GUI, which provides favorable detection outcomes.
